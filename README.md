# Physics Syllabus Important Graphs & Diagrams

This project contains a comprehensive collection of important physics graphs and diagrams based on the syllabus covering five chapters:

- Electromagnetic Theory
- Quantum Physics
- LASER and Fiber Optics
- Solid State Physics
- Electromagnetic Waves

## Features

- Visual illustrations of key physics concepts including:
  - Displacement and conduction current graphs
  - Electric and Magnetic Fields in EM waves
  - Poynting vector directions
  - Quantum energy level diagrams
  - de Broglie wavelength vs velocity graph
  - Compton effect interaction diagrams
  - Population inversion and LASER emission mechanisms
  - Optical fiber structure and acceptance angle
  - Solid state physics band diagrams and distributions
  - Superconductor characteristic graphs
  - Plane wave electric and magnetic field variations
  - Skin depth and power flow illustrations

- Modern, clean, and mobile-responsive SVG-based diagrams.
- Easy to open and view in any modern web browser without additional dependencies.
- All code contained in a single HTML file with inline SVG, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to view all the diagrams.

The file is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing, fitting within 350px width and 600px height without requiring scrolling.

## Purpose

This resource is designed for students looking for clear visual references to key physics concepts, useful for:

- Exam preparation
- Theory understanding
- Visual learning aid

## Notes

- The diagrams are created using scalable vector graphics (SVG), ensuring crisp display at any screen size.
- No external libraries or internet connection required.
